### Model component

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Model.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the malitio data.
* stores the history and future of data-changing commands in stacks of InputHistory.
* exposes a `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyFloatingTask>`, `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyDeadline>`, `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyEvent>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list
  so that the UI automatically updates when the data in any of the list change.
* exposes the two stacks of InputHistory (history and future) for access by UndoCommand and RedoCommand.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

### Storage component

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Storage.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Malitio data in xml format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.malitio.commons` package.

## Implementation

### Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels
and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file
  (See [Configuration](#configuration))
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to
  the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

**Logging Levels**

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging
  e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

### Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file 
(default: `config.json`):


## Testing

Tests can be found in the `./src/test/java` folder.

**In Eclipse**:
* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose
  `Run as` > `JUnit Test`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose
  to run as a JUnit test.

**Using Gradle**:
* See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) for how to run tests using Gradle.

We have two types of tests:

1. **GUI Tests** - These are _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. 
   These are in the `guitests` package.
  
2. **Non-GUI Tests** - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
   1. _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. <br>
      e.g. `seedu.address.commons.UrlUtilTest`
   2. _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units 
     (those code units are assumed to be working).<br>
      e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
   3. Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as 
      how the are connected together.<br>
      e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`
  
**Headless GUI Testing** :
Thanks to the [TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) library we use,
 our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. 
 In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen.
 That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.<br>
 See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md#running-tests) to learn how to run tests in headless mode.
 
#### Troubleshooting tests
 **Problem: Tests fail because NullPointException when AssertionError is expected**
 * Reason: Assertions are not enabled for JUnit tests. 
   This can happen if you are not using a recent Eclipse version (i.e. _Neon_ or later)
 * Solution: Enable assertions in JUnit tests as described 
   [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2522897/eclipse-junit-ea-vm-option). <br>
   Delete run configurations created when you ran tests earlier.
  
## Dev Ops

### Build Automation

See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

### Continuous Integration

We use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects.
See [UsingTravis.md](UsingTravis.md) for more details.

### Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.
 
 1. Generate a JAR file [using Gradle](UsingGradle.md#creating-the-jar-file).
 2. Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
 2. [Crete a new release using GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/) 
    and upload the JAR file your created.
   
### Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, malitio depends on the
[Jackson library](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome) for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_
can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which
is better than these alternatives.<br>
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)<br>
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)<br>

## Appendix B : Use Cases

(For all use cases below, the **System** is `Malitio` and the **Actor** is the `User`, unless specified otherwise)

#### Use case: Delete a floating task

**MSS**

1. User requests to delete a specific floating task in the floating task list
2. Malitio deletes the floating task <br>
Use case ends.

**Extensions**

1a. The given index is invalid

> 1a1. Malitio shows an error message <br>
  Use case restarts at step 1

#### Use case: Edit a floating task

**MSS**

1a. The given index is invalid

> 1a1. Malitio shows an error message <br>
  Use case restarts at step 1
  
#### Use case: Changing the data file location of Malitio

**MSS**

1. User requests save data file at a user-specified file path
2. Malitio remembers the change and saves data file from then on. <br>
Use case ends.

{More to be added}

## Appendix D : Glossary

##### Floating task

> A task that has no deadline

## Appendix E : Product Survey

**Desktop Reminder**<br>
Desktop Reminder is a desktop application and can be run in offline mode. It has an alert system which will ring at a specified time (determined by user) to alert the user of upcoming tasks. However, the drawback of this application is that it does not minimize to the system tray when user clicked on the 'X' button but instead, gets minimized as a window which will hover on top of the taskbar.

**Google Calendar and Google Task**<br>
Google Calender displays the event and on the right side, Google Task shows the tasks which needs completion. This view enables user to see what task they have on which days easily. However, a drawback is that google task is rather simple and does not have a lot of features.

**Remember The Milk**<br>
Remember The Milk (RTM) allows users to categorize task which is useful if users want to group related task together. However, a drawback of RTM is that it does not allow users to input specific reminders before the events (e.g. 10minutes before, 1 day before, etc) but only have a general reminder which will be through email to the task. Since there is a mobile app for this, the inability to generate mobile reminders (e.g. alarm or notification) is a potential hindrance especially to users who do not check their emails often.

#### Adding a task: `add`
Adds a task to the to-do list<br>
There are three types of tasks that can be added in Malitio: To-Do, Deadline and Event.<br>
Alphanumeric (alphabets and/or numbers) tags can be added.<br>

Floating Task Format: `add TASK_NAME [t/TAG]`<br>
Deadline Format: `add TASK_NAME by DATE/TIME [t/TAG]`<br>
Event Format: `add TASK_NAME start DATE/TIME end DATE/TIME [t/TAG]`<br>
Note: TASK_NAME cannot contain any of the following key words: "by", "start" and "end".<br>

Examples: 
* `add drink water t/healthy`
* `add CS2103 homework by 09-10 1100`
* `add buy present for friend by tomorrow`
* `add lunch with mom start 05-10 1400 end 05-10 1700 t/dontbelate t/restaurant`
* `add wedding dinner start this sat 6pm end this sat 10pm t/buypresent`

```

#### Edit a task : `edit`
Edits the specified task from the to-do list.<br>
Edit Floating Task Format: `edit 'f'INDEX [TASK_NAME] [t/TAG]`<br>
Edit Deadline Format: `edit 'd'INDEX [TASK_NAME] [by DATE/TIME] [t/TAG]` <br>
Edit Event Format `edit 'e'INDEX [TASK_NAME] [start DATE/TIME] [end DATE/TIME]` <br>
To remove all tags from a task, use the parameter: t/null <br>
Note: TASK_NAME cannot contain any of the following key words: "by", "start" and "end".<br>


> * Edits the task at the specified `INDEX` with the given one or more parameters.
> *  The index refers to the index number shown in the most recent listing.<br>
> *  The index **must have either 'f','d' or 'e' as a prefix and also a positive integer** f1, e2, d3, ...<br>
> *  At least one of the optional parameters must be present <br>
> *  The prefix is not case sensitive. <br>
> *  The edit function can only edit the details within the same type of task. <br>
> *  Editting the tags will result in a replacement of all tags. <br>

Examples: 
*  `edit e1 end 12-21 2359` <br>
  Edits the 1st event in the schedule list, replacing its original end time with 21 December. <br>
*  `edit f1 lunch with mom`<br>
  Edits the 1st task in the to-do list, replacing its original name with "lunch with mom".<br>
*  `edit d2 t/wedding t/love`<br>
  Edits the 2nd deadline in the deadline list, replacing its existing tags with the tags: 'wedding' and 'love'.<br>

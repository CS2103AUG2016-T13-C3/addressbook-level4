### Model component

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Model.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the malitio data.
* stores the history and future of data-changing commands in stacks of InputHistory.
* exposes a `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyFloatingTask>`, `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyDeadline>`, `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyEvent>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list
  so that the UI automatically updates when the data in any of the list change.
* exposes the two stacks of InputHistory (history and future) for access by UndoCommand and RedoCommand.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

#### Adding a task: `add`
Adds a task to the to-do list<br>
There are three types of tasks that can be added in Malitio: To-Do, Deadline and Event.<br>
Alphanumeric (alphabets and/or numbers) tags can be added.<br>

Floating Task Format: `add TASK_NAME [t/TAG]`<br>
Deadline Format: `add TASK_NAME by DATE/TIME [t/TAG]`<br>
Event Format: `add TASK_NAME start DATE/TIME end DATE/TIME [t/TAG]`<br>
Note: TASK_NAME cannot contain any of the following key words: "by", "start" and "end".<br>

Examples: 
* `add drink water t/healthy`
* `add CS2103 homework by 09-10 1100`
* `add buy present for friend by tomorrow`
* `add lunch with mom start 05-10 1400 end 05-10 1700 t/dontbelate t/restaurant`

#### Edit a task : `edit`
Edits the specified task from the to-do list.<br>
Edit Floating Task Format: `edit INDEX [TASK_NAME] [t/TAG]`<br>

To remove all tags from a task, use the parameter: t/null <br>
Note: TASK_NAME cannot contain any of the following key words: "by", "start" and "end".<br>


> * Edits the task at the specified `INDEX` with the given one or more parameters.
> *  The index refers to the index number shown in the most recent listing.<br>
> *  The index **must have either 'f','d' or 'e' as a prefix and also a positive integer** eg. f1, e2, d3, ...<br>
> *  At least one of the optional parameters must be present <br>
> *  The prefix is not case sensitive. <br>
> *  The edit function can only edit the details within the same type of task. <br>
> *  Editting the tags will result in a replacement of all tags. <br>
